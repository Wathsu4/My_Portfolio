          Website for Mental Care Support<br /><br />

          Description:<br />
          This project is a comprehensive website designed to provide mental
          care support, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
          React.js, and Node.js). This initiative significantly contributed to
          the enhancement of my frontend development skills and fostered a
          passion for creating user-friendly interfaces. The project was a
          collaborative effort, highlighting the importance of teamwork and
          communication. Its primary aim is to assist individuals dealing with
          mental health challenges by offering accessible resources and support.
